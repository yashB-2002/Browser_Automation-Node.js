# Browser Automation with Node.js

- Browser automation is the process of automatically performing operations on a web browser.
- Browser Automation can be done using Node library Puppeteer.
- Puppeteer is a Node library which provides a high-level API to control Chrome or Chromium over the DevTools Protocol. 
- Through puppeteer we can automate anything we do on browsers like emulating a key press, a click etc.
- This activity also requires knowledge of JS concepts -> Promises and DOM.
